# 📊 Employee Attendance Dashboard – Power BI

An **interactive Power BI dashboard** designed to visualize employee attendance using dynamic visuals, SVG images, and optimized DAX logic.

This project demonstrates how to creatively apply Power BI features to personalize reports and optimize performance.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The dashboard tracks:
- Individual employee attendance
- Working days and present days
- Team-level segmentation
- Employee profile cards with images

It was developed with a focus on **interactivity**, **visual storytelling**, and **data-driven design**.

## 🔍 Key Features

✅ **SVG inside DAX** – to render dynamic employee profile visuals  
✅ **Image URL to Base64 conversion** – embedded directly as image bytes  
✅ Solved a critical visual bug by switching from **Multi-row Card** to **Table**  
✅ Dynamic DAX logic using:
- `SELECTEDVALUE()` to fetch individual data
- Date calculations for present/working days
- Conditional formatting for visuals

✅ Performance optimized for large string handling (image bytes)
